## Design



### Goals

#### 1. Support a broad set of CLDR functionality in the browser

#### 2. Minimize the size of resource bundles

A huge challenge in supporting a broad set of functionality is the large amount of data that must be reachable from the browser environment.



-----

 * Support a broad set of CLDR features in the browser, "out of the box"


 * Support applications that in turn provide users a high degree of control over final formatting
